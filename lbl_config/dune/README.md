# DUNE inputs

Status: work in progress on branch `dune-genie-ar23`.

## Source

`tdr2017/` holds the ancillary files of arXiv:2103.04797v2, downloaded
2026-11-09 from arxiv.org. The paper states the fluxes were produced with
G4LBNF v3r5p4 for the optimized engineered beam design used in the DUNE TDR.
The same version string (`v3r5p4`, `OptimizedEngineeredNov2017`) appears in the
GLoBES flux file names in `tdr2017/globes_config/flux/`, which are
byte-identical to the FD `*_globes.txt` files in `tdr2017/flux/`.

Checksums of every file are in `tdr2017/SHA256SUMS.txt` (paths relative to `tdr2017/`).

## Flux ROOT histograms

- Bin content is the per-bin integrated flux in nu/m^2/POT, with variable bin
  width: 0.125 GeV up to 8 GeV, 0.5 GeV up to 20 GeV, 2 GeV up to 118 GeV.
  Verified by comparing the plain sum of `numu_flux` in
  `flux_dune_neutrino_FD.root` with the integral of the numu column of the
  matching GLoBES flux file (ratio 1.000000). Do not multiply by bin width.
- Only the `*_flux` histograms are used. `*_fluxosc` and `*_eventrate*` are not
  used because their oscillation parameters and units are not documented.
- Flux locations: near detector (ND) 574 m and far detector (FD) 1297 km
  downstream of the start of Horn 1.

## GLoBES-format flux text files (`*_globes.txt`)

Units nu/GeV/m^2/POT, 7 columns: energy at bin centre, nue, numu, nutau,
nuebar, numubar, nutaubar; 0.25 GeV steps.

## globes_config/

Kept unmodified as the source of the far-detector smearing matrices and
post-smearing efficiencies. GLoBES itself is not used by this repository.
